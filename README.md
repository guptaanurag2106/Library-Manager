# Library-Manager

This is a library manager web-app including both front-end and back-end. It has a user login logout system, in which user can login and view his/her books. He/She can issue the
books from the library. It also has a admin and a librarian system in which the admin is the person who can change anything. admin can remove users and librarians, promote users to 
librarians, and can revoke their roles. Librarians can change the data relating to books, add new books, and issue new books. 
At present the role of librarian and admin has not created but I will add it soon. At present it is a just a minimalistic website in which users can login/out, view thier books, see all
the books and issue new books. The other features will soon be added.
